<h1>The different types of cars are as follows</h1>

<section id="hatchback">
<h2>HATCHBACK</h2>
<h3>A hatchback is a car body configuration with a rear door that swings upward to provide access to a cargo area.
 Hatchbacks may feature fold-down second row seating, where the interior can reconfigured to prioritize passenger or cargo volume.
  Hatchbacks may feature two- or three-box design.</h3>

<section id="sedan">
<div>

	<h2>SEDAN</h2>
	<h3>A sedan is a car with a closed body (i.e. a fixed metal roof) with the engine, passengers, and cargo in separate compartments.[3] This broad definition does not differentiate sedans from various other car body styles, but in practice the typical characteristics of sedans are:

a B-pillar (between the front and rear windows) that supports the roof
two rows of seats[5](p134)
a three-box design with the engine at the front and the cargo area at the rear
a less steeply sloping roofline than a coupé, which results in increased headroom for rear passenger and a less sporting appearance.
a rear interior volume of at least 33 cu ft (0.93 m3)
It is sometimes suggested that sedans must have four doors (to provide a simple distinction between sedans and two-door coupés).However, several sources state that a sedan can have two or four doors.In addition, terms such as sedan and coupé have been more loosely interpreted by car manufacturers since 2010.

When a manufacturer produces two-door sedan and four-door sedan versions of the same model, the shape and position of the greenhouse on both versions may be identical, with only the B-pillar positioned further back to accommodate the longer doors on the two-door versions.</h3>

<section id="mpv">
<div>
	<h2>MPV</h2>
	<h3>
MPV is short for multi-purpose vehicle – a type of car generally favoured by families due to a more practical interior than a regular hatchback's, often coming in five- and seven-seat forms.

Range of sizes
Smaller MPVs – sometimes based on superminis such as the Ford B-Max – come with five seats and a practical interior, while the Citroen C4 Picasso and Ford C-Max can also come in a seven-seat form (the Citroen Grand C4 Picasso and Ford Grand C-Max, for example).

Others, such as the Volkswagen Touran and SEAT Alhambra, are designed to be seven-seaters from the start, however. The latter of the two comes with practical sliding side doors and a huge interior.

Read about more motoring terms in our full glossary here
All MPVs major on practicality, with spacious boots and flexible interiors where the seats can be configured, folded, flipped and stowed, depending on how many passengers you’re carrying.


The MPV bodystyle has declined in popularity in recent years though, due to the growth in more fashionable SUVs offering similar levels of flexibility and practicality in a more desirable package.

Pros
Spacious, flexible interiors, smaller examples easy to use around town.

Cons
Larger examples difficult to manoeuvre, dull image compared with fashionable SUVs, rarely offer any off-roading capability unlike some SUVs. 

Examples
Ford B-Max, Renault Scenic (and Renault Grand Scenic), Ford Galaxy

	<h2>SUV</h2>
	<h3>A sport utility vehicle or SUV is a car classification that combines elements of road-going passenger cars with features from off-road vehicles, such as raised ground clearance and four-wheel drive.

There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of an SUV, and usage of the term varies between countries. Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a light truck chassis; however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with off-road design features to be an SUV. A crossover SUV is often defined as an SUV built with a unibody construction (as with passenger cars), however, in many cases, crossovers are simply referred to as SUVs. In some countries — such as the United States — SUVs have been classified as "light trucks", resulting in more lenient regulations compared to passenger cars.

The predecessors to SUVs date back to military and low-volume models from the late 1930s, and the four-wheel drive station wagons and carryalls that began to be introduced in 1949. The 1984 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) is considered to be the first SUV in the modern style. Some SUVs produced today use unibody construction; however, in the past, more SUVs used body-on-frame construction.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the popularity of SUVs greatly increased, often at the expense of the popularity of large sedans and station wagons. More recently, smaller SUVs, mid-size, and crossovers have become increasingly popular. SUVs are currently the world's largest automotive segment and accounted for 36.8% of the world's passenger car market in 2017.</h3>

<section id="crossover">
<div>
	<h2>CROSSOVER</h2>
	<h3>A crossover SUV (CSUV) – also called a crossover utility vehicle (CUV) – is a type of sport utility vehicle (SUV) of unibody construction. Crossovers are often based on a platform shared with a passenger car. Compared to truck-based SUVs, they typically have better interior comfort, a more comfortable ride, superior fuel economy, and less off-road capability. Many crossovers lack all-wheel drive, which, in combination with their lesser off-road capability, challenges their definition as "sports utility vehicles". Furthermore, there are inconsistencies about whether some vehicles are considered crossovers or SUVs; therefore, the term "SUV" is often used as a catch-all for both crossovers and compact SUVs. Crossovers may be sometimes also classified as light trucks in some countries, even though they are smaller than their bigger counterparts.

In the United States as of 2006, crossover models comprised more than 50% of the overall SUV market.Crossovers have become increasingly popular in Europe also since the early 2010s.

Forerunners of the modern crossover include the 1977 Matra Rancho and the AMC Eagle introduced in 1979.</h3>

<section id="coupe">
<div>
	<h2>COUPE</h2>
	<h3>A coupé is a fixed-roof car with a sloping rear roofline and one or two rows of seats. However, there is often debate surrounding whether a coupe must have two doors or whether cars with four doors can also be considered coupés. This debate has arisen since the early 2000s, when four-door cars such as the Mazda RX-8 and Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class have been marketed as "four door coupés" or "quad coupés".

In the 1940s and 1950s, coupes were distinguished from sedans by their shorter roof area and sportier profile.Similarly, in more recent times, when a model is sold in both coupé and sedan body styles, generally the coupe is sportier and more compact.

The 1977 version of International Standard ISO 3833—Road vehicles - Types - Terms and definitions—defines a coupé as having two doors (along with a fixed roof, usually with limited rear volume, at least two seats in at least one row and at least two side windows).On the other hand, the United States Society of Automotive Engineers publication J1100 does not specify the number of doors, instead defining a coupe as having a rear interior volume of less than 33 cu ft (934 L).</h3>

<section id="convertible">
<div>
	<h2>CONVERTIBLE</h2>
	<h3>A convertible, cabriolet or spyder/spider (/ˌkæbrioʊˈleɪ/) is a passenger car that can be driven with or without a roof in place. The methods of retracting and storing the roof vary between models. A convertible allows an open-air driving experience, with the ability to provide a roof when required. Potential drawbacks of convertibles are reduced structural rigidity (requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the effects of removing a car's roof) and cargo space.

The majority of convertible roofs are a folding construction made from cloth. Other types of convertible roofs include retractable hardtops (often constructed from metal or plastic) and detachable hardtops (where a metal or plastic roof is manually removed and often stored in the trunk).</h3>
